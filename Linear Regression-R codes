# Linear Regression

In the dataset of automobiles, in order to find the relationship between miles per gallon(dependent variable) with cylinder, displacement,
weight, horsepower, acceleration and model year(independent variables). I used simple and multiple linear models. There were total 398
observations about automobiles. Using Rstudio*, I explored the data and found that variable horsepower was captured in factor instead of
numeric format and there were some data entry issues as some entries were marked as "?". When I changed this variable from factor to
numeric format, the issue resolved as NA; in R, missing values are represented by the symbol NA (not available). After this, I divided the 
dataset into two parts, i.e., training set and test set. Training set has 300 observations, whereas test set has 98. I did this for 
validation. Using the training dataset, I fitted approximately 60 models (please refer the log submitted with the report) and selected the
best model based on the highest value of adjusted R squared. I use adjusted R squared  instead of multiple R squared because it also 
adjusts the number of predictors in selecting the best model. The best model: 
	
mpg=6.761682+(-0.353565 )cylinder+(-0.005489)weight+(0.447231)model.year

has adjusted R squared 0.8143 and multiple R squared 0.8161. Using this model, I predicted the value of the mpg of test set
(98 observations).
